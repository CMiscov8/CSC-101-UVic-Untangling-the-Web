Interested in getting involved in the tech sector but don't know where to start?  Meetups, MOOCs, bootcamps, diplomas and degrees all offer different paths, and finding the right fit for your lifestyle when you are a newcomer to the community can be quite challenging!  The _Untangling the Web_ series is designed to help you take that first step into the world of web-centric computing with a group of like-minded people.  This series includes an introduction to resources, programs, and career options for people who have no prior experience in the tech sector.  

Topics include an introduction to tools for analyzing and building web-based applications that manage critical information about people and organizations.  By the end of the course, you will have an understanding of _full stack_ development, with representative front-end and back-end examples for your own digital portfolio.  Course content is project-based, and will include the opportunity to learn from industry mentors along the way.
