MOOCs, bootcamps, diplomas and degrees all offer different paths, and finding the right one for your lifestyle can be challenging.  If you want to take a first step into the world of web-centric computing with a group of like-minded people, and understand the opportunities available for getting involved, the _Untangling the Web_ series could be for you.
